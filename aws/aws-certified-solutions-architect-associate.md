Concepts and components
---------------

Regions and AZs
* Region is a geographical location
* Each region has 2 or more availability zones - each AZ is a datacenter (or two)
* AZs are far enough apart to survive disasters etc
* Services should be across multiple AZs for HA

Edge locations
* End points for AWS used for caching content
* Content delivery networks
* Lots more edge locations than regions.
