S3
======================================

* One of the oldest services
* S3 = Simple storage service
* Object storage
* Really cheap
* 0B - 5TB object size - "Unlimited storage" globaly
* Files are stored in buckets
* Buckets = folders
* S3 is a universal namespace - names need to be globaly unique
* URL format: https://s3-region-amazonaws.com/bucket
* File upload - HTTP 200 return code if sucsessful
* 99.99% SLA from Amazon
* 11x9% file duribility
* Supports SSL

* Managed globaly!

Tiered storage options and Lifecycle management
* Move data to other tiers based on age / hotness
* S3 - base level 11x9% can sustain loss of 2 facilities
* S3 - IA (Infrequent access) - for slightly colder data - cheaper storage but has a retreval fee - 128K min
* Reduced reduancy storage only 99.99% durability + reliability - cheaper
* Glacier - very cheap but 3-5 hours retreval time

Versioning
* Allows for multiple versions of a Object

Enctyption

ACLs + bucket policies

Data consistency
---------------
* Read after write consistency for PUTS  of new
* Eventual consistency for overwrite or removal PUTS - takes time to propagate around
* Updates are atomic

Objects
---------------

Each object has:

Key - the name
* Objects are distributed around based on name - lots of items around the same
alphabetical sorting may cause performance issues

Value - your data

ID
* What version of this object

Metadata

Subresources
* ACLs
* Torrent - S3 supports torrent protocol

Charging
---------------

Storage
Requests
Storage management pricing - tags etc
Data transfer pricing - into S3 is free
Transfer acceleration
* Uses edge location

Buckets
---------------

* Bucket name needs to be uniqe globaly
* Buckets can be tagged - objects within the bucket don't inherit

Access control
* ACLs or bucket policies

Can add MFA for deleting / visioning buckets / objects

Versioning
---------------

* Bad for large files changing frequently
* Cannot be disabled - only suspended

* All versions are stored
* Integrates with lifecycle rules

Cross region replication
---------------

Create 2nd bucket in another region
If using versioning - both buckets need it
Can be in another AWS account

Only new objects or modified are replicted at first

When you delete the delete marker is replicated
if you delete the delete marker that isn't replicated!

If using versioning removing a version in bucket1 doesn't replicate

Lifecycle management
---------------

* Based on time since first creation - not last access!
* Whole bucket or a prefix
Move from standard S3 -> infrequent access -> glacier

Infrequent access
---------------

* 128K + 30 days age

Glacier
---------------

* All objects have a minimum 90 day charge


Security and Encryption
---------------

By default all buckets / objects are private
* Bucket policies
* ACLs
* Logs can be enabled - to another bucket (in this account or another)

Data in transit
* SSL/TLS

Data at reset - Server side (In AWS)
* S3 managed key - __SSE-S3__
* AWS Key management service (KMS), managed keys - __SSE-KMS__
  * Envelope keys - keys for your keys
  * Full audit trail - who encrypted and when
* Serverside encryption with customer prived keys - __SSE-C__

Data at reset - Client side
* DIY

Transfer acceleration
---------------

Uses Cloudfront edge network to accelerate upload straight to your closest edge location and then into S3 via the AWS backbone

New endpoint URL to use for upload


Hosting a static website
---------------

__If using Route53 bucket name must be the same as domain name__ (not including top level)
i.e domain dave.guru will need a bucket called dave

URL for this:
__${bucketname}.s3-website-${region}.amazonaws.com__

Needs public read on objects

Scales infinitely / automatically without worrying about load balancers etc
