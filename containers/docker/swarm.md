Docker swarm
================================

Basic docker orchestration, but is pretty much a dead end.

Manager node + worker nodes

Intergrated into docker itself

Scaling, service discovery, load balancing, rolling updates etc

# Docker service
Created on master, pushed out to workers to impliment

Core part of swarm
